Hej, I am Per and I am currently finishing my studies in statistics (M.Sc.) and computer engineering (B.Sc.) in Berlin.
I believe that (modern) life requires constant learning. Thus, I like to challenge myself both professionally and personally.

# Personal interests
When it comes to sports, I happily join any endeavor, no matter if it's cycling through the woods for days or playing football at the beach.
There are days where I indulge in one Sci-Fi book after another while walking through the streets of Berlin.

# Currently reading / exploring / watching
- I am very excited about the movie [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(2021_film))
and the tv adaption of [Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series)

# My favorite quotes
- *Look for the bare necessities, the simple bare necessities. Forget about your worries and your strife* – The Jungle Book.
- *Perhaps it would be better only to consider whether it is right to do this; and, if it is, to do it.* – David Copperfield by Charles Dickens.
- *Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.* – Soren Kierkegaard.
