Hej, I am Per and I recently finished my studies in Statistics (M.Sc.) and Computer Engineering (B.Sc.) in Berlin.
I believe that (modern) life requires constant learning. Thus, I like to challenge myself both professionally and personally.
You can find my CV [here](/src/CV_Per_Joachims.pdf).

# Personal interests
When it comes to sports, I happily join any endeavor, no matter if it's cycling through the woods for days or playing football at the beach.
There are days where I indulge in one Sci-Fi book after another while walking through the streets of Berlin.

# Currently reading / exploring / watching
- I just started to watch the tv show [Sluga Naroda](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6235122/), which tells the fictious story of an Ukrainian teacher (portrayed by now president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy) becoming the next president. A total surreal experience in light of what happens in the Ukraine at the moment.
- Alexandre Dumas' masterpiece [The Count of Monte Cristo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo)
- I learned a lot about history and the events that led to the WW1 by listenig to [Fall of Giants](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7315573-fall-of-giants) by Ken Follett. I wish a large chunk of my history lessens in school could have been replaced by studying this book. This again significies the preference of the human mind for stories over hard facts. Still, I am very excited about how technology will shape the future of education, e.g., children could experience historical events first-hand with the use of AR / VR.
