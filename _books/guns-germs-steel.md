# Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond
## Motivation
> *Why did history unfold differently on different continents?* - Jared Diamond

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>"developed"</th>
    <th>non-"developed"</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10,000 BC</td>
    <td colspan="2" align="center"> No striking differences, all still hunter-gatherer (HG) </td>

  <tr>
    <td>1,500 AD</td>
    <td>sedentary society with guns, germs, and steel</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Observing similar starting points in 10,000 BC ending and striking differences in 1,500 AD, why did some develop the *proximate factors* guns, germs, and steel and others not, leading to the former conquering the latter?
What are the *ultimate factors* behind this?

## Food production
- Why did HG change into farmers?
  1. availability of wild food
  2. increased availability of domesticable wild plants
  3. technology -> easier farming
  4. increase in populations (2-way)
  5. competition with other tribes

### Plant domestication

#### Why was Fertile Crescent so fertile?
- Unfair starting location advantage
